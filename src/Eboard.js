                I joined Tamid my First Year and have been a member of the Investment 
                Fund for all three years. I have enjoyed leading and discussing stock

                bio="I am a Junior from Brussels, Belgium, and I joined Tamid in the 
                Spring of my Freshman year.  After deciding to concentrate in APMA-CS, 
                joining the Tamid Fund was an excellent way for me to continue learning 
                about Finance, which was a growing interest of mine throughout my 
                Freshman year, alongside my studies. Since then, the fund has grown a 
                lot and has allowed for me to learn about various facets of Finance, 
                from the Stock Market and stock pitching, to accounting and valuation 
                methods, which were all incredibly useful throughout the Finance 
                recruitment process. My favorite part of being Co-Director of The 
                Fund is teaching new members about the many things that I have 
                learned during my time in Tamid." img={julian}/>

                at which point I knew very little about finance. Thanks to TAMID 
                and my own curiosity, I've since learned how to run my own portfolio, 
                worked for a hedge fund in Sydney, written finance related op-eds for 
                BPR, become a fund manager at TAMID, and landed an Investment Banking 
                job in New York. In my spare time I love to backpack around the world." img={simon}/>
