            No. While many members are pursuing business majors, other members 
            study a variety of disciplines including economics, political science, 
            engineering, and more.

            <p>
            Mandatory requirements for the education period include attending 
            weekly meetings. Once a full-member, members are committed to 
            attending TAMID night each week and performing research outside of 
            meetings. Being in TAMID is very rewarding, and what you put into 
            the organization is likely what you will get out of it.
